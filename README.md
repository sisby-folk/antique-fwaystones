<center>Automatic atlas markers for discovered waystones.</center>
<center>Requires <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/antique-atlas">Antique Atlas</a> and <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/fwaystones">Fabric Waystones</a> </center>

---

Notes:
 - Markers are automatic and cannot be removed by players.
 - Added waystone markers are global - anyone with that part of their atlas revealed will see waystones.
 - Markers will be renamed when their waystone is renamed.
 - Markers will be removed when their waystone is broken.

### Afterword

All mods are built on the work of many others.

This mod is included in [Tinkerer's Quilt](https://modrinth.com/modpack/tinkerers-quilt) - our modpack about rediscovering vanilla.

We're open to suggestions for how to implement stuff better - if you see something wonky and have an idea - let us know.
